1. Make both paragraph elements wrap around the image.
2. Use Float to move the river div to the left and the mountain div to the right.

  <div class="river">
    <h2>River Stream</h2>
    <img src="river.jpeg" alt="calm river" />
    <p>The river flowed gently through the valley, reflecting the sky like a mirror. Fish swam near the surface while
      children played along the banks. Its calmness brought serenity to everyone nearby.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="mountain">
    <h2>Mountain View</h2>
    <img src="mountain.jpeg" alt="beautiful mountain" />
    <p>The mountain stood tall against the horizon, its peaks covered in snow. Birds chirped as the wind whispered
      through the pine trees. It was a peaceful retreat, perfect for hiking and reflection.</p>
